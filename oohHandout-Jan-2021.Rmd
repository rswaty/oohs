# LANDFIRE Open Office Hours

LANDFIRE is a multi-partner program producing and delivering over two dozen datasets and hundreds of ecological models that depict vegetation and fire conditions, past and present.  These monthly LANDFIRE Office Hours provide a place to learn a LANDFIRE-based skill, discuss LANDFIRE data use and build community.


# Obtaining LANDFIRE spatial data

There are multiple ways to obtain LANDFIRE spatial data-we discussed two main ways:

1. [Downloading mosaics](https://www.landfire.gov/version_comparison.php).  If you have plenty of storage space, work on a large landscape, or work on many landscapes we recommend downloading the mosaics, which are full extent datasets for the Lower 48 states, Alaska and Hawaii (selected and downloaded separately). For example, we will download the Existing Vegetation Type mosaic for the lower 48 states and clip it as needed as opposed to using the Data Download Site for each landscape we are working on.

2. [Using the LANDFIRE Data Distribution Site](https://www.landfire.gov/viewer/). If you have limited storage space, a small number of landscapes, and/or would like to download several datasets at once for them, we recommend this method.

3. For a complete exploration of ways to download LANDFIRE data visit [Get Data](https://www.landfire.gov/viewer/).

# From your questions and discussion, January 2021
To listen to the entire conversation visit our [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/zlXDjtJPYgw). There were a few followup items we wanted to address here:

* During the demo of the [LANDFIRE Data Viewer and Distribution Site](https://www.landfire.gov/viewer/viewer.html) participants noted the useful "Modify" button that becomes available once you select the datasets of interest, and your geography for downloads.  Once you select "Modify" on the Request Summary page you can take actions such as change the Output Projection and Datum from NAD 1983 Albers (standard) to "Best-Fit UTM (NAD83 Datum) which will improve performance in some instances. We will be providing more information on this during an upcoming LANDFIRE postcard.
* As you may know LANDFIRE is continually updating data and improving processes.  While the schedule is at times a bit fluid, visit the [LANDFIRE Schedule](https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php) page for more information on versions and release schedule.  Check back periodically and watch the postcard for up to date information.
* There was a question around submitting information to LANDFIRE.  This was much appreciated as data quality is largely driven by plots and feedback.  Please visit the [Reference Data](https://www.landfire.gov/participate_refdata.php) and also click the "Contribute Data" tab on www.landfire.gov for more information.
* The answer to the Event ID and Point ID question provided in the video (asked at 22:24) was not correct. Contact the LF Helpdesk for clarification helpdesk@landfire.gov.
